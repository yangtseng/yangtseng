abstract: "Predicting drug responses based on individual transcriptomic profiles holds promise for refining prognosis and advancing precision medicine. Although many studies have endeavored to predict the responses of known drugs to novel transcriptomic profiles, research into predicting responses for newly discovered drugs remains sparse. In this study, we introduce scDrug+, a comprehensive pipeline that seamlessly integrates single-cell analysis with drug-response prediction. Importantly, scDrug+ is equipped to predict the response of new drugs by analyzing their molecular structures. The open-source tool is available as a Docker container, ensuring ease of deployment and reproducibility. It can be accessed at https://github.com/ailabstw/scDrugplus."
