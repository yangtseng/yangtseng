abstract: Single-cell genomic technologies have offered the potential for uncovering gene modules, and discovering prospective drugs. While identifying signature gene sets has become popular in single-cell omics, module detection methods with transitional gene sets identification are still lacking. In this study, we introduce a distance-based module detection method, based on Pearson correlation coefficient matrix, with capacity of transitional gene set identification. We benchmark the method against current methods for module detection through calculating the ratio of modules corresponding to gene sets in Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database. Next, we apply the method on dataset of 14 neuroblastoma patients, an embryonal malignancy cancer type in childhood, belonged to different cancer stages for revealing the stage transitional sets during cancer progression. Additionally, we reveal several drug candidates targeting the stage-transitional gene sets via drug repurposing, offering new treatment options for neuroblastoma. In summary, we present a distance-based gene module detection method capable of identifying transitional gene sets for further drug discovery analysis.
