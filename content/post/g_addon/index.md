Supported by the NTU International Cooperation Add-on Project, I joined Dr. Okada's lab in Japan to study mathematical modeling of cell signaling systems. There, I developed a mathematical model of cellular senescence and successfully simulated nuclear NFÎºB levels under various conditions. (Grant: 112L8503)
